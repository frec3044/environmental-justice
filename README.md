Code is contained in the `env-justice.qmd` notebook, and final rendered output files (`climate-change.md` and associated files) are in the `assignment` directory as well. The general rubric you will be graded on is found in the `rubric.md` file.

- `lesson.md` a description of the assignment.
- `rubric.md` the rubric for how the module will be accessed.
- `.gitignore` Optional file, ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this.
