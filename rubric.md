# Environmental Justice Module: Detailed Rubric

### Module weight: X pts

Question 1:

-   Full Credit: Map is for Richmond, VA and matches the style of the plots in `env-justice-tutorial.qmd` with NDVI for the different polygon classes

-   Partial Credit: Map is present but missing NDVI, polygons, or other element in `env-justice-tutorial.qmd` maps. Map is not for Richmond, VA.

-   No Credit: Not answered or no map shown

Question 2:

-   Full Credit: Table has two columns (grade and mean NDVI) with one NDVI value per grade. Values in the table are correct.

-   Partial Credit: Table has two columns (grade and mean NDVI) with one NDVI value per grade. Values in the table are clearly incorrect.

-   Partial Credit: Table does not have correct columns or too many rows (multiple values of NDVI for a grade)

-   No Credit: Not answered.

Question 3:

-   Full Credit: Correctly loaded data using tidyverse functions

-   No Credit: Did not correctly load data.

Question 4:

-   Full Credit: Five cities are listed. An environmental or demographic variable is identified and a range is provided. The variable has variation in it.

-   Partial Credit: Missing one or more of the following: five cities, variable, or range in variable. Or variable does not show variation

-   No Credit: No answer was provided

Question 5:

-   Full Credit: Five maps are provided for each of the cities. Maps match the style of the plots in `env-justice-tutorial.qmd` with NDVI for the different polygon classes.

-   Partial Credit: Missing maps or maps deviate from the style in `env-justice-tutorial.qmd` (e.g. no polygons, NDVI, etc).

-   No Credit: No answer was provided

Question 6:

-   Full Credit: An insightful description is provided that connects to the five figures in Question 5.

-   Partial Credit: Description provide but is cursory

-   No Credit: No description was provided.

-   Partial Credit: Code does not correctly generate the three required columns

-   No Credit: No answer provided

Question 8:

-   Full Credit: Plot is provided with five lines (different colors for each line) for the cities, grade on x-axis, and mean NDVI on the y-axis. The axes have useful labels. Title and legend are present.

-   Partial Credit: Minor errors in the plot Plot is provided but one of the required elements missing or incorrect (colors, axes, labels, title, labels)

-   Partial Credit: Major errors in the plot. Plot is provided but multiple of the required elements missing or incorrect (colors, axes, labels, title, labels).

-   No Credit: No plot provided.

Question 9:

-   Full Credit: Correct calculation of relative difference using tidyverse code and table provided

-   Partial Credit: Error in calculation of relative difference, does not use tidyverse code, or table not provided

-   No Credit: No calculations or a table provided

Question 10:

-   Full Credit: Plot is provided with one line, environmental variable on x-axis, and relative difference in NDVI on y-axis. The axes have useful labels. Title and legend are present.

-   Partial Credit: Minor errors in the plot Plot is provided but one of the required elements missing or incorrect (axes, labels, title, labels)

-   Partial Credit: Major errors in the plot. Plot is provided but multiple of the required elements missing or incorrect (colors, axes, labels, title, labels).

-   No Credit: No plot provided.
