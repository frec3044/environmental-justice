## Environmental Legacy of redlining

\
\
Â  What is the present-day impact of historic "redlining" of US cities during the Great Depression on ecological processes?

## Context: Redlining {.smaller}

-   The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) was a government-sponsored corporation created as part of the New Deal
-   The HOLC created a housing appraisal system of color-coded maps that categorized the riskiness of lending to households in different neighborhoods
-   Lower grades = less opportunity for loans but lower grades also = minority communities
-   Red-lining: A discriminatory practice in which financial services are withheld from neighborhoods that have significant numbers of racial and ethnic minorities
-   It was outlawed in 1968 following the passage of the civil rights bill.

## Data: Mapping Relining

-   Mapping Relining is a project at the University of Richmond that provides maps of HOLC grades in cities across the U.S.

-   Maps are available as polygons for use in geospatial analysis

## Context: Canopy cover {.smaller}

-   Trees and vegetation influence the local temperatures
-   Generally: more trees/canopy, cooler local temperatures

Sentinel 2

-   10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolution

-   Since 2015

-   Maps every 10 days

## Data: Satellites

-   Satellites record reflected light in different regions of the light spectrum (wavelengths)

-   Data = a value of average intensity over a window of wavelengths ("band")

-   Bands are chosen because they measure different aspects of the environment.

## Data: Indices

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Bands can be combined to get indices that measure ecological processes
-   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) \~ photosynthesis (amount + health of vegetation)
-   Higher NDVI = more canopy = cooler local temperatures

## Data: Raster

Band and NDVI across space are stored as rasters

![](img/RasterOriginVsExtents_611x402.png){fig-alt="diagram of a raster" fig-align="center"}

## Data: Data Cubes

Rasters are combined over time to form data cubes

## Data: COGs and GeoTIFFs

\
\
\
Full remote sensing data sets are huge! (many bands, locations, times)

## Data: COGs and GeoTIFFs

-   A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file aimed at being hosted on an HTTP file server with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud.
-   Leverages the ability of clients to request just the parts of a file they need. (https://cogeo.org)
-   GeoTIFF is a public domain metadata standard that allows georeferencing information to be embedded within a TIFF file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF)
