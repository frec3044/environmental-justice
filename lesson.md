# Climate change module

## Overview

What is the evidence for a changing climate? In this unit, we will examine some of the most important indicators of global climate change, including CO2 concentration, global mean temperature, sea level rise, land ice sheet melt, and arctic sea ice cover. We will wrangle a wide range of tabular data file formats used by NOAA and other agencies and introduce the fundamentals of data visualization with `ggplot2` and data processing with basic functions from the `readr`, `tidyr`, and `dplyr` packages as we seek to replicate the principle results of climate change over the last decades and also the past thousands of years. In particular, in this module, we will recreate the now-famous "Hockey-stick" curve combining present and historical CO2 records from [Petit et al. (1999, *Nature*)](https://doi.org/10.1038/20859 "Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica").

## Questions

 - What is the evidence for a changing climate?
 - How do find & interpret data sources behind leading climate change indicators?
 - How do we read and plot this data in a scriptable & reproducible manner?
 - How do we communicate technical analysis in notebook formats that combine code, text, and visuals?

## Objectives

  - Become familiar with a wide range of tabular data formats
  - Become familiar with reading data into R and generating plots in `ggplot`
  - Demonstrate ability to use RStudio and GitHub workflows to demonstrate reproducible output.
  - Demonstrate ability to communicate clearly in code, written text, and visual formats.
## Requirements:

  - `tidyverse`
  - `R`
  - RStudio
  - Git & GitHub.

## Instructions

  - Open the notebook `assignment/climate-change.qmd` in RStudio
  - Work through the exercises described in the notebook.
  - `knit` + commit output files to GitHub

## Context


## Timeframe

  - This module is usually delivered over 1 week (2 75-minute class sessions).
