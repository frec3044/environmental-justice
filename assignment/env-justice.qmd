## Learning objectives

This module provides an introduction to the fundamentals of working with spatial vector and raster data in R while empirically exploring why systematic and structural racism is interwined with urban ecological processes. This module uses the Simple Features Access standard (ISO 19125) and tidyverse-style workflow using the sf package and emerging ecosystem of r-spatial tools.

## Background

In August 2020, [Christopher Schell](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/users/1757114) and collegues published a review in *Science* on ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay4497) (DOI: 10.1126/science.aay4497), showing how systematic racism and classism has significant impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes within urban environments. Here we explore a subset of the data used to support these findings in this review and the broader literature.

The [press release](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/08/13/systemic-racism-has-consequences-for-all-life-in-cities/) on the paper is worth a read:

> “Racism is destroying our planet, and how we treat each other is essentially structural violence against our natural world,” said lead author Christopher Schell, an assistant professor of urban ecology at the University of Washington Tacoma. “Rather than just changing the conversation about how we treat each other, this paper will hopefully change the conversation about how we treat the natural world.”

In the paper, Schell writes:

> "In multiple cases, neighborhood racial composition can be a stronger predictor of urban socio-ecological patterns than wealth."

We are going to explore one metric for how structural racism and classism underpin landscape heterogeneity in cities.

**Figure 2** in the Schell paper shows how NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) tracks historical redlining.

We are going to create map like these, and plot the distributions and mean vegetation patterns across cities to explore the structural inequality and racism that Schell et al highlight in their paper.

To do this we are going to use the following spatial data:

#### Mapping Inequality: (vector data)

Please take the time to read the introduction to this dataset [here](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=3/41.245/-105.469&text=intro)

> "As you explore the materials Mapping Inequality, you will quickly encounter exactly that kind of language, descriptions of the "infiltration" of what were quite often described as "subversive," "undesirable," "inharmonious," or "lower grade" populations, for they are everywhere in the HOLC archive ....These grades were a tool for redlining: making it difficult or impossible for people in certain areas to access mortgage financing and thus become homeowners. Redlining directed both public and private capital to native-born white families and away from African American and immigrant families. As homeownership was arguably the most significant means of intergenerational wealth building in the United States in the twentieth century, these redlining practices from eight decades ago had long-term effects in creating wealth inequalities that we still see today. Mapping Inequality, we hope, will allow and encourage you to grapple with this history of government policies contributing to inequality."

#### Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (raster data)

NDVI is used as proxy measure of vegetation health, cover and phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. It is calculated using multiple bands from satellite images.

## Warm-up questions

**Question 1:**

Using the `env-justice-tutorial.qmd` as the template, create a map which shows current mean NDVI within each grade class polygon in Richmond, VA.

**Answer 1:**

```{r}

```

**Question 2:**

Create a table that displays the mean NDVI for the different grade classifications within Richmond, VA. (one value per grade.)

**Answer 2:**

```{r}


```

## Examining how the influence of redlining varies across city environmental or demographic characteristics

In this section, you are going to examine how the relative difference between the highest grade and lowest grade differ between cities. You will then explore how that difference is related to environmental or demographic differences among the cities.

**Question 3:**

Read in the characteristics of the different cities in the dataset. The characteristics are in the CSV called `data/city_data.csv`. City data was generated by combining <https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities> with daymet meteorology data (<https://daymet.ornl.gov>)

**Answer 3:**

```{r}


```

**Question 4:**

Pick **five** cities that span a range of environmental or demographic characteristics. Select one variable in the data set from Question 3 that 1) interests you and 2) has a large enough range where you see differences across your five selected cities.

**Answer 4:**

```{r}

```

**Question 5:**

Generate a map of NDVI within each class for each city (5 separate plots).

**Answer 5:**

City 1

```{r}
#| echo: false


```

City 2

```{r}
#| echo: false


```

City 3

```{r}
#| echo: false


```

City 4

```{r}
#| echo: false


```

City 5

```{r}
#| echo: false


```

**Question 6:**

Describe any visual differences among the city in the patterns of NDVI across the classes.

**Answer 6:**


**Question 7:**

Extract the mean NDVI for the different grade classes for each of your five selected cities.

**Answer 7:**

```{r}

```

**Question 8:**

Plot the values for the different classes for the five cities on the same graph (x axis is class, y axis is mean NDVI, color is city).

**Answer 8:**

```{r}


```

**Question 9:**

Calculate the relative difference between the lowest and highest class for each city.

**Answer 9:**

```{r}


```

**Question 10:**

Use a plot to answer the question: Does the relative difference between the highest and lowest classes vary with the environmental or demographic characteristic you choose in Question 3?

**Answer 10:**

```{r}


```
